# 5-Minute Future-Focused Brand Discovery

This quick questionnaire will help shape your unique personal brand strategy. Answer instinctively - your first thoughts are often the most authentic.

## Brand Discovery

- im writing 5 questions for a personal brand discovery questionnaire that will cover:
  - archetype
  - content pillars
  - communication style
  - target audience
  - brand values
  - brand personality

- Use NLP techniques of future pacing, word of mouth optimization, and avatar creation to guide the questions

- Focus on making the questions easy to answer bsased on what someone knows they like and knows they want to be like, don't ask about things they don't know or haven't thought about

- the goal is to elicit maximum information from minimal questions using heuristics that are generally easy to answer with
  - e.g. don't ask ideal audience, since people don't know that.. ask them who they like, who they want to help
  - e.g. don't ask brand values, ask what rules they use to create positive karma
  - e.g. don't ask who they follow or how they consume content, figure out how they like to create it and lead it
  - focus on future state, don't ask "how have you helped people", ask "looking back in 5 years, how have you helped people"
  - target for questions is leaders, influencers, professionals, artists, investors, etc.
  - questions should be focused on drawing out who they want to be, and helping them become that person
  - questions should be minimal and succinct, using analogues and heuristics to make them easy to answer and provide maximum information
